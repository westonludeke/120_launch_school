# Which of these two classes has an instance variable and how do you know?

class Fruit
  def initialize(name)
    name = name
  end
end

class Pizza
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

# only the Pizza class, because it includes the @ symbol before the variable, which shows it is an instance variable.
