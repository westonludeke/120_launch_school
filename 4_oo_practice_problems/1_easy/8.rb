# If we have a class such as the one below:

class Cat
  attr_accessor :type, :age

  def initialize(type)
    @type = type
    @age  = 0
  end

  def make_one_year_older
    self.age += 1
  end
end

# You can see in the make_one_year_older method we have used self. What does self refer to here?

# Answer: 'self' refers to the instance variable @age

# Correct Answer: Firstly it is important to note that 'make_one_year_older' is an instance method and can only be called on instances of the class Cat. Keeping this in mind, the use of 'self' here is referencing the instance (object) that called the method - the calling object.
