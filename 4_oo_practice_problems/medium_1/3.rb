# In the last question Alan showed Alyssa this code which keeps track of items for a shopping cart application:

class InvoiceEntry
  attr_accessor :quantity, :product_name

  def initialize(product_name, number_purchased)
    @quantity = number_purchased
    @product_name = product_name
  end

  def update_quantity(updated_count)
    self.quantity = updated_count if updated_count >= 0
  end
end

towel = InvoiceEntry.new('towels', 3)
towel.update_quantity(4)
p towel.quantity

# Alyssa noticed that this will fail when update_quantity is called. Since quantity is an instance variable, it must be accessed with the @quantity notation when setting it. One way to fix this is to change attr_reader to attr_accessor and change quantity to self.quantity.

# Is there anything wrong with fixing it this way?
