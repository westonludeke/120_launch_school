# Let's examine some code that implements polymorphism through inheritance:

class Animal
  def eat
    # generic eat method
  end
end

class Fish < Animal
  def eat
    # eating specific to fish
  end
end

class Cat < Animal
  def eat
     # eat implementation for cat
  end
end

def feed_animal(animal)
  animal.eat
end

array_of_animals = [Animal.new, Fish.new, Cat.new]
array_of_animals.each do |animal|
  feed_animal(animal)
